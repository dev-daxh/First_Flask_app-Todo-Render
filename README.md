# Flask TODO App

Welcome to my Flask TODO app! This is a simple application built using Flask for the backend and SQLAlchemy for database management. This project marks the beginning of my journey into backend development with Python.

## Project Overview

This TODO app allows users to:

- **Add** a new TODO item with a title and description.
- **Read** existing TODO items.
- **Update** existing TODO items.
- **Delete** TODO items.

All data is stored using SQLAlchemy, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that simplifies database interactions.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete TODO items.
- **Database Integration**: Uses SQLAlchemy to handle database operations.
- **Flask Framework**: Serves as the backend framework to manage requests and responses.
- **Frontend Integration**: Integrates with a basic frontend to demonstrate how Flask can handle dynamic content and data interaction.

## Installation

To get started with the Flask TODO app, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-todo-app.git
   cd flask-todo-app

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  
   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Set Up the Database**

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
5. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   flask run or python -m app.py

   The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:/8000.

# Features in Detail
Flask Backend

Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. It is designed to be simple and easy to extend, allowing for fast development and easy integration with frontend technologies. Hereâ€™s how it handles various backend tasks in this app:

- **Routing**: Flask maps URLs to functions using routes. This app defines routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting TODO items.
- **Request Handling**: Flask processes incoming requests and dispatches them to the appropriate route function.
- **Templates** : Flask uses Jinja2 templates to render HTML pages with dynamic data.


**SQLAlchemy Integration**

SQLAlchemy is used to manage database interactions with an ORM approach:
- **Models**: Define classes representing database tables. This app uses a Todo model to represent TODO items.
- **Sessions**: Manage database transactions and queries.

**Frontend Integration**
The app includes a basic frontend that interacts with the Flask backend:
- **HTML Forms**: Allow users to submit data for creating and updating TODO items.
