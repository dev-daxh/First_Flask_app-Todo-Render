# Flask TODO App

Welcome to my Flask TODO app! This is a simple application built using Flask for the backend and SQLAlchemy for database management. This project marks the beginning of my journey into backend development with Python.

## Project Overview

This TODO app allows users to:

- **Add** a new TODO item with a title and description.
- **Read** existing TODO items.
- **Update** existing TODO items.
- **Delete** TODO items.

All data is stored using SQLAlchemy, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that simplifies database interactions.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete TODO items.
- **Database Integration**: Uses SQLAlchemy to handle database operations.
- **Flask Framework**: Serves as the backend framework to manage requests and responses.

## Installation

To get started with the Flask TODO app, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
